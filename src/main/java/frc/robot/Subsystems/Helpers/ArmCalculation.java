     * TO WHOEVER THIS MAY CONCERN:
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * 
     * To find an equation for the arm, we need to gather a table of distance from
     * the speaker and the angle of the shoulder. To obtain the distance from the
     * speaker, we will use the limelight (not sure which value off the top of my
     * head). The limelight is currently set to only see 1 id for testing. Make sure
     * to change this at some point! The telescope will be all the way
     * in for simplicity. When you have at least 3 points, you can use desmos or
     * chatgpt (which I'd recommend) to find an equation that fits the data. Then,
     * replace the 0 in the below method and you should have working arm
     * calculations!!1!!!1! I would then test this a lot to make sure it works. Next
     * up will be autonomous: make it run the paths and hopefully auto aim.
     * 
     * I really hope someone reads this
